                <h2>Javascript</h2>
                <p> Formerly known as LiveScript, JavaScript is a text-based dynamic programming language known for its web-based applications. It is a lightweight, open, and cross-platform language with the original purpose of creating network-centric applications.</p>
                    <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Download Now!</a>
                <p><br> Additionally, it is one of the trio of web design and programming, namely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While HTML and CSS give the structure and style of a webpage, JavaScript provides the dynamic and interactive objects and elements found in a website.

                <h2>About Javascript</h2>
                <p> As mentioned, JavaScript provides the various interactive elements found in a webpage. Its ability to store values in variables, run code in response to events, and do operations on pieces of text allows it to be a valuable language for web design.</p>

                <p><br>The showing of information, changing colors of a button, zooming in or out of an image, playing audio or video, displaying animations, and dropping-down elements are all thanks to JavaScript. In addition, it gives viewers and visitors immediate feedback, a secure browser, and a richer interface.</p>

                <h2>Uses of Javascript</h2>
                <p>Besides its interactive and dynamic uses in web design, JavaScript also has applications in developing mobile apps. JavaScript front-end frameworks include libraries that allow programmers to use pre-written code for certain features and tasks.</p>

                <p><br> It can also build back-end infrastructures and build web servers and other server applications. In addition, game development is another use for JavaScript and a great way for beginners to practice their programming skills.
