                <h2>Swift</h2>
                <p>First released in 2014, Swift has been making the rounds as an easy, modernized, Objective-C rival. Swift was designed by Apple to be a fast and simple programming language for creating programs for Apple operating systems, Linux, Windows, and Android.</p>
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Download Now!</a>
                <p><br> It's an accessible open-source programming language that was influenced by Python. Swift's powerful type inference and pattern matching, along with its modern, lightweight syntax, make it feasible to express complicated ideas in a simple and understandable way.

                <h2>About Swift</h2>
                <p>Swift is the result of the latest research on programming languages, combined with decades of experience building Apple platforms. Named parameters are expressed in a clean syntax that makes APIs in Swift even easier to read and maintain. Even better, you don’t even need to type semi-colons.</p>

                <p><br>Inferred types make code cleaner and less prone to mistakes, while modules eliminate headers and provide namespaces. To best support international languages and emoji, Strings are Unicode-correct and use a UTF-8 based encoding to optimize performance for a wide-variety of use cases. Memory is managed automatically using tight, deterministic reference counting, keeping memory usage to a minimum without the overhead of garbage collection.

                <h2>Uses of Swift</h2>
                <p> From its earliest conception, Swift was built to be fast. Using the incredibly high-performance LLVM compiler technology, Swift code is transformed into optimized native code that gets the most out of modern hardware. The syntax and standard library have also been tuned to make the most obvious way to write your code also perform the best whether it runs in the watch on your wrist or across a cluster of servers.
                </p>

                <p><br>Swift is a successor to both the C and Objective-C languages. It includes low-level primitives such as types, flow control, and operators. It also provides object-oriented features such as classes, protocols, and generics, giving Cocoa and Cocoa Touch developers the performance and power they demand.
