                <h2>Ruby</h2>
                <p>Ruby is an open source, interpreted, object-oriented programming language created by Yukihiro Matsumoto a Japanese computer programmer, in the mid-1990s., who chose the gemstone's name to suggest "a jewel of a language."</p>
                    <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Download Now!</a>
                <p><br> Ruby is designed to be simple, complete, extensible, and portable. Matsumoto was an expert on multiple programming languages at the time, including Perl, Eiffel, Smalltalk, Lisp, and Ada. When creating Ruby, he tried to combine what he thought were the best elements of each of these languages.

                <h2>About Ruby</h2>
                <p>Ruby was designed for programmer productivity with the idea that programming should be fun for programmers. It emphasizes the necessity for software to be understood by humans first and computers second. That makes Ruby a highly flexible programming language, since it allows its users to freely alter its parts.</p>

                <p><br>Essential parts of Ruby can be removed or redefined, at will. Existing parts can be added upon. Ruby tries not to restrict the coder. Ruby is also a highly portable, cross-platform language. Code you write on one operating system will run on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows. It will even run in UNIX, DOS, BeOS, OS/2, and more.

                <h2>Uses of Ruby</h2>
                <p> Ruby has many uses since it is a highly flexible language. It is great for building desktop applications, static site generation, web scraping, data processing services, and even automation tools. Ruby is also used for web servers, DevOps, and web scraping and crawling.
                </p>

                <p><br>More specifically, Ruby is a scripting language designed for front- and back-end web development, as well as other similar applications. It’s a robust, dynamically typed, object-oriented language, with high-level syntax that makes programming with it feel almost like coding in English. In fact, some people feel that they can practically understand Ruby code before even learning how to program.</p>
