                <h2>C</h2>
                <p> C is one of the oldest, most fundamental, and most widely used programming language. Developed by Dennis M. Ritchie, its original purpose was to write UNIX operating systems at the Bell Telephone Laboratories. Today, C is known as a fast, portable, middle-level language with an extensive library that was the successor of the B language.

             <li><i>"It is said that C is a god’s programming language. One can say, C is a base for programming. If you know C, you can easily grasp the knowledge of the other programming languages that use the concept of C.”</i><br>- Barbara Thompson</li>

                <h2>About C</h2>
                <p> One of the strong suits of the C programming language is that it only uses 32 keywords that are easy to remember and master. Other than being a software development language, it teaches programmers about the internal architecture of a computer and how it stores and retrieves information. Its lack of a safety system allows it to be flexible and access information anywhere.
                </p>

                <p><br>It has a procedural programming language with a static system that has the functionality of structured programming, recursion, and lexical variable scoping. C was created with constructs that transfer well to common hardware instructions. It has a long history of use in programs that were previously written in assembly language. </p>

                <h2>Uses of C</h2>
                <p> Apart from its primary use of writing operating systems, the C programs language can help make embedded systems, databases, and new programming languages. Additionally, designers and animators use C to create 3D movies as it can store a large quantity of data. Its other uses include being a text editor, print spooler, network driver, and language interpreter.
                </p>

                <p><br>It is also mainly used to create many types of applications and operating systems such as Windows, and other complicated programs such as the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and games and is considered a programming foundation in the process of learning any other programming language. </p>
