                    <h2>CSS</h2>
                    <p>Let’s start at the beginning. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets,and it’s used to add style to a web page by dictating how a site is displayed on a browser. CSS is unique in that it doesn’t create any new elements, like HTML or JavaScript. Instead, it’s a language used to style HTML elements.</p>

                    <p><br>CSS is responsible for the text style, size, positioning, color, and more on a website. It’s also what controls how a website’s style shifts between desktop and mobile versions. Without CSS, websites would look pretty boring.</p>

                 <li><i> CSS can save you time. Once you have a style sheet created, you can use it multiple times. CSS is efficient. Only a few lines of code are required to dictate the style on a webpage, which speeds up loading time and keeps files relatively lightweight. </i> - Advantages of CSS</li>

                    <h2>Types of CSS</h2>
                    <p> There are three types of CSS styling: internal, external, and inline. The types of CSS refer to how CSS is implemented. Internal CSS, which is also called embedded CSS, is the practice of inserting the CSS code in the head section of the HTML document that defines a specific website.</p>
                    <p><br>The second type of CSS is external, where the style sheet is kept in a file separate from the HTML code. As we discussed earlier, this is the preferred type of CSS for many developers and companies.</p>
                    <p><br>The final type, inline CSS, is where the CSS code is applied within the HTML code but is not globally applied to a particular element. Instead, the CSS code is used within the HTML code to alter a single element.</p>

                    <h2>How to CSS</h2>
                    <p>We’d recommend you learn HTML first and then check out a course on learning CSS. Because CSS is used with HTML in various ways, a solid understanding of HTML is required before you can jump straight into altering HTML elements using CSS. </p>
    
                    <p><br>If you’re just starting out with both CSS and HTML, you can even take a learning path tailored to both. HTML is used to structure the website, and then CSS is layered over top for style. With both skills, you’ll have the full suite required to get down to work designing and building websites.</p>
