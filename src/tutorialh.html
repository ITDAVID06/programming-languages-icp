                    <h2>HTML</h2>
                    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) uses a markup system composed of elements which represent specific
                        content. Markup means that with HTML you declare what is presented to a viewer, not how it is presented.</p>
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_intro">Try it Yourself!</a>
                    <p><br>HTML is sometimes called a programming language but it has no logic, so is a markup language. HTML tags
                        provide semantic meaning and machine-readability to the content in the page. A HTML page may consist of potentially hundreds of elements which are then read by a web browser, interpreted
                        and rendered into human readable or audible content on the screen.</p>

                    table, footer. For this document it is important to note the difference between elements and tags. </i> - Element and Tag Insight</li>

                    <h2>About HTML</h2>
                    <p> Let's break down a tag...
                        The 'p' tag represents a common paragraph.
                        Elements commonly have an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag contains the element's name in angle
                        brackets (p). The closing tag is identical to the opening tag with the addition of a forward slash (/) between the
                        opening bracket and the element's name (/p).
                        Content can then go between these two tags: (p) This is a simple paragraph.(/p)</p>
    
                    <p><br>The following HTML example creates a simple "Hello World" web page.
                        HTML files can be created using any text editor. The files must be saved with a .html or .htm[2] extension in order
                        to be recognized as HTML files.
                        Once created, this file can be opened in any web browser.</p>

                    <h2>Uses of HTML</h2>
                    <p> HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. The update improved the language's functionality, enabling the use of features that previously required additional software like browser plugins. It also added the ability to create applications using HTML that function offline. </p>
    
                    <p><br>Now that we understand HTML tags and elements, letâ€™s take a closer look at what the language can do. In summary HTML structures the webpage, navigates the internet for us, it can embedd images and videos and game development. </p>
